Feature Selection 
It is a method to reduce the inputs to the model for a large dataset as processing each and every columns will take up a lot of time as it will compare all the possible outcomes one by one so we generally do feature selection so that we can reduce the input variables to the machine by considering 5 best columns or 10 best columns for a very big dataset.Getting rid of the noise from irrelevant data set. In short feature selection is the process of isolating the most consistent, non-redundant, and relevant features to use in model construction.
